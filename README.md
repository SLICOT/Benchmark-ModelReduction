# **Model Order Reduction Benchmark**  

## About 

The `Model Order Reduction Benchmark` (`Benchmark-ModelReduction`) contains MATLAB MAT-files with data for several "real world" examples, reflecting current problems in applications, which can be used to test the numerical methods for model reduction.

The data files can be individually downloaded from (https://github.com/SLICOT/Benchmark-ModelReduction/blob/main/benchmodred.html).
